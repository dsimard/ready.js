Help for ready.js was spread at every corner of the planet which made me international but was difficult to maintain.

The [old blog was on Posterous][posterous] but I just don't understand what is going on since the _Spaces_ thing and their acquisition by Twitter.

I will update the package to _v2.0.2_ but nothing will change except documentation. I will also remove the wiki because... I just hate to update it.

By the way, I just reached **280 followers** today.
